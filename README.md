# Who I am

[Link to my portfolio](http://winstonzhao.com)

I'm a software engineer who loves creating and finding technology that makes life easier. I became interested in software engineering after I taught myself VBA to make my last job more efficient. I came up to San Francisco to sharpen my skills at AppAcademy. Now every day, I get so excited from either finding a great chrome extension, learning how to build something more easily with JavaScript/HTML/CSS, or even creating a new keyboard shortcut. During the month, you'll find me at almost every JavaScript meetup in San Francisco. I'm hungry to learn and excited to dive into a role that will allow me to pursue my passion for implementing technology that makes life simpler and better.
